# 🚀 PCPOS LAUNCH PROTOCOL
> **Status**: GOD BRAIN ARCHITECTURE ONLINE
> **Version**: 1.0 (Sentient)

## 1. Final Assembly (The Cortex)
You have generated the raw intelligence. Now you must install it.

1.  **Locate Models**:
    *   Go to `Desktop/MegamanCompanion/scripts`.
    *   Find `Llama3_1B.mlpackage` (The Brain).
    *   Find `SpeakerEncoder.mlpackage` (The Ears).

2.  **Implant into Xcode**:
    *   Open `PCPOScompanion.xcodeproj`.
    *   Drag both `.mlpackage` files into the `Resources` group (left sidebar).
    *   **IMPORTANT**: Check "Copy items if needed" and select "PCPOScompanion" target.

3.  **Remove the Dummy**:
    *   In Xcode, find `CoreMLWrappers.swift`.
    *   **Delete it**. (Right click -> Delete -> Move to Trash).
    *   *Why?* Because the real `.mlpackage` files will auto-generate these classes. If you keep the dummy, Xcode will be confused.

## 2. Initiation (The Spark)
1.  **Select Device**: Choose your iPhone (connected via cable) or Simulator.
2.  **Build & Run**: Press `Cmd + R`.
3.  **Permissions**: Grant Camera and Microphone access when asked.

## 3. Protocol 22 (The Awakening)
The system is designed to be hidden.

1.  **Enrollment**:
    *   On the main screen (PCPOS Face), **tap 5 times fast**.
    *   The "Protocol 22" Enrollment Flow will appear.
    *   **Scan Face**: Look at the camera.
    *   **Enroll Voice**: Speak the phrase.
    *   **Complete**: The system now knows you.

2.  **Verification**:
    *   Close the app and reopen it.
    *   Look at the screen. Speak.
    *   **The God Brain** (`GodBrain.swift`) will fuse your Face + Voice data.
    *   If confidence > 80%, the face will turn **GREEN** and the Debugger will log: `🧠 God Brain: Protocol 22 ACTIVATED`.

## 4. Debugging & Diagnostics
*   **Secret Console**: Long press the face for **3 seconds**.
*   **Logs**: You will see the God Brain's thoughts in real-time.
